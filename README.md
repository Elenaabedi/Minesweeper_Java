# Minesweeper_Java
The provided code represents a game called "Minesweeper." In this game, the player is presented with a hidden game board represented by a grid. The board consists of cells that can contain either a bomb ('X') or a blank space ('-'). The objective of the game is to uncover all the blank spaces without detonating any bombs.

At the beginning of the game, the board is initialized with blank spaces, and a certain number of bombs are randomly placed on the board. The count of bombs in each cell is then calculated and marked with a numeric value indicating the number of adjacent bombs.

The game is played by revealing cells on the board based on user input. The player continues to uncover cells until either all the blank spaces are revealed or a bomb is encountered, resulting in game over.
